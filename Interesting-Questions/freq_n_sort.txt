Question: 
========
Given a sorted array, how will you find the frequency of occurence of a given element  in O(log n)

Solution: 
========
recursively apply BST on the two halves of the list 
START: lists are [a1,a2..ax], [0]
LATER: lists are [a1..an], [an...ax]
where an is the element we have to find the frequency for

Drawbacks:
=========
Thinking on it :-)
